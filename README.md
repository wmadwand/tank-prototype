# Block Games Developer testing task

This is a small game where the player controls a tank with a turret. 
There is no main goal in the game itself, apart from the tank destroying all cubes in the scene.
The project contains a few inconsistencies between it's code and assets, as well as has issues that need to be adressed.
Your task is to complete the outlined tasks below and if there is time and passion - add in something from yourself to improve the game.

Please try to fit your work inside of **2-3 hours**.
The time it took you will not be a big judging factor as long as it is not too much over the limit and every task is complete.

Please commit your changes into the provided repository as you would normally, a Pull request is not neccesary for the completion of the task.

If any issues or questions arise, do not hesitate to contact us for clarification.

## Tasks
* Organise / name TestScene hierarchy
* Fix camera Jitter when moving
* Make sure that the tank moves from input depending on where the camera is looking
* Modify targeting to use a range variable in what range to search for targets 
* Implement a health system for targets, so they are not killed with one shot 
* Targeting seems to wrongly aim the turret when aiming at static targets 
* Fix issue where turret ignores moving targets -Make sure the laser only lasts for about 0.1 seconds after being shot and then dissapears 
* Make sure the code is cleaned up and readable / consistent and as performant as possible 
* Double check if the Project folder structure is organised
